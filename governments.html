<h2>How We Help</h2>
<p>Government technology ends up in the news more often for its failure—most famously Healthcare.gov—than for its success. It's easy to lay the blame on the staff. In truth, they are just small players in a massively broken system: contracts with unbreakable locks; custom builds with no manuals, resources, or open community; and procurement rules that box out new, creative startups. Fortunately, new models are emerging—you just have to know where to look. That's where we can help: not just by finding an existing (much cheaper) solution to your problem, but also by setting the rules and processes to make this the new normal.</p>
