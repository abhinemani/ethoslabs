<h2>How We Help</h2>
<p>There are now hundreds of startups actively disrupting the $100B+ government technology ecosystem, working in thousands of jurisdictions, with the support of tens of millions of investment dollars. Yet â€” for those of us working in the field&mdash;we know that we have truly just scratched the surface. More support is needed to get to the next phase of govtech innovation: <strong>more sales traction</strong> for existing startups, <strong>more investments</strong> to help them grow, and <strong>more advice and guidance</strong> as they reach scale in this new territory. <strong>That's what we offer at EthosLabs.</strong>
