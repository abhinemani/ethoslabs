<h2>How We Help</h2>
<p>There are now hundreds of startups actively disrupting the $100B+ government technology ecosystem, working in thousands of jurisdictions, with the support of tens of millions of investment dollars. Yet â€” for those of us working in the field&mdash;we know that we have truly just scratched the surface. More support is needed to get to the next phase of govtech innovation: more sales traction for existing startups, more investments to help them grow, and more support and guidance as they reach scale in this new territory. That's what we offer at EthosLabs.
