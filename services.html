<h2>How We Work</h2>

Pricing is on a hourly + retainer model. Contact Ethos to discuss further. </li>

	<h3>Government Workshop</h3>
	<p>This is an intensive, bespoke program, designed to create a rapid path forward on a pressing / prioritized issue for the government: for example, digitizing analog processes or data-driven performance management. Senior leadership from relevant departments and from the executive office (i.e. City Manager's or Mayor's Office) are expected to attend. As necessary, Ethos may bring in experienced former city leaders to consult and share best practices. Goal is to develop a concrete path forward for partnering with startups/non-profits to move the needle on the stated issue area.</b></p>
