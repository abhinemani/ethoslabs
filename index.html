	<h1>{{ page.description }}</h1>
	<p>Good government in the 21st century means good technology. But often it seems too hard for new startups to get into the business of government, even though <b>innovative public servants and entrepreneurs want to work together.</b></p>
	<p>That's where we come in. Founded by <a href="/model/#bio">Abhi Nemani</a>, <b>EthosLabs</b> is a technology and strategy consultancy that brings to bear experience from inside and outside government, ranging from cities such as Sacramento and Los Angeles, to companies such as GovDelivery, CityGrows, Code for America, and OpenGov Foundation&#8212;just to name a few.</p>
	<p>Having sat on both sides of the table, we know who to talk to and how; what's working and what's not; and best practices to get the job done.</p>
	<p>Let's get to work.  <a href="/contact">Drop us a line</a>: abhi.nemani@gmai.com.</p>
