<h1>INNOVATION AND GROWTH FUND</h1>
<p>As part of the Mayor‚Äôs Economic Development 3.0 strategy, the Mayor‚Äôs Office recommended to to the City Council a repurposing of the existing Innovation and Growth Fund towards diversifying and growing the economy through new technologies and new industries. </p>
<p>Three areas of focus were identified: </p>
<ol><li>Supporting a Pipeline of talent and startups in Sacramento (RAILS program)</li>
<li>Making it simpler, easier, and smarter for companies to work with City Hall (CHIPS)</li>
<li>Connecting and highlighting the region‚Äôs successful innovations (MOFIE)</li></ol>
<p>These three IGF strategic programs were designed to be sustainable over time, falling under the expected $2M annual revenue from the special fund supporting the IGF. Additionally, with a reserve balance of $5-8M the city retains its ability to make larger scale strategic investments as opportunities arise. <a href="http://sacramento.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=21&amp;event_id=2826&amp;meta_id=471926"><strong>This $10M plan ‚Äî which makes it the largest innovation fund of its kind ‚Äî was presented to the Council in May 2016, and it was approved unanimously (9-0).</strong></a></p>
<p>Following this vote, the Economic Development Department, the Information Technology Department, and the Mayor‚Äôs Office collaborated to identify concrete recommendations for appropriations for Council to fulfill the IGF‚Äôs goals and objectives.</p>
<h1>PIPELINE FOR STARTUPS</h1>
<h2>RAILS: Rapid Acceleration, Innovation, and Leadership in Sacramento</h2>
<p>After a thorough review of other cities‚Äô innovation programs, Sacramento decided to focus not simply on an individual company or organization, but instead the pipeline for entrepreneurship: from training new leaders, to incubating new projects, and finally scaling up successful ideas. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://cityofsacramento.org/RAILS">RAILS</a> program (Rapid Acceleration, Innovation, and Leadership in Sacramento) was designed to have the city act as a platform to support each piece of that pipeline; for example a STEAM education program for area youth, or a hackathon focused on civic issues. Leveraging funds from the Innovation and Growth Fund, the city allocated up to $1M in grants for these ‚Äústartup enablers‚Äù to openly compete for funding.</p>
<p>After receiving 100+ applications in a short span of just 4 weeks, and going through an extensive review process with internal and external leaders, City management selected 15 grantees for council to consider for funding. (<a href="http://www.cityofsacramento.org/RAILS/2016/index.html#/">&gt;See the full list here</a>.) These 15 organizations represent the following values, which reflect the City‚Äôs value and unique strengths): </p>
<ul><li>Diverse, Inclusive, and Creative</li>
<li>Broad-based innovation in fabrication, energy, avionics &amp; more</li>
<li>Civic &amp; Socially Oriented</li></ul>
<p>(Already multiple cities have asked to repurpose this program for their own locality, and to put it into perspective, LA‚Äôs innovation fund took 1.5 years to go through council, and then another year before the first grant was made. Sacramento is on pace to do both within 6 months.)</p>
<p><strong>Status</strong>: Council <i>unanimously</i> approved the 15 organizations on November 1.</p>
<!--<h1>SIMPLE, EASY, & SMART CITY HALL</h1>
<h2>CHIPS: City Hall Innovation Pilots in Sacramento (Under Construction)</h2>
<p>The City Hall Innovation Pilots (CHIP) program is designed to encourage the best innovators building government technology to come work with us, in Sacramento, to make the city a world-class digital city. In fact there are a key focus areas where innovation is critical: transportation, public safety, and permitting for example. Through a joint process with city leaders, we can identify those areas and then challenge entrepreneurs to solve them. Their pilots will let us as a city learn what works and what doesn't, and then build upon those learnings to scale up innovation.</p>
<p>Outcomes will include:</p>
<ul><li>Solving real existing challenges for city departments</li></ul>
<li>Improving customer service for citizens through digital tools</li>
<li>Connecting city staff to outside entrepreneurs</li>
<li>Finding low-cost solutions to typically multi-year, multi-million dollar contracts</li>
<li>Highlighting Sacramento as a leader in government technology</li></ul>-->
