<h2>Accelerating Good Government Through Great Technology</h2>
<p> tate and local governments in the US spend nearly $100B on technology every year; all the while, 99% of government technology projects fail. <b>This has to change. And it's starting to.</b> A marketplace of new govtech startups is emerging, eager to change the way government works, using principles of the modern web: open, collaborative, and an ethos of constant improvement. To get into this market, however, either as a government or a company, is hard. That's where EthosLabs come in. We help <b>governments</b> understand and engage this marketplace and educate <b>startups</b> on which innovative governments are looking for new, creative solutions.</p>
