Together, <strong>Abhi Nemani</strong> and <strong>Bob Sofman</strong> have deep experience in the civic tech space: from co-leading a civic tech non-profit (Code for America), to leadership roles in government (City of Los Angeles) and civic startups (SmartProcure). 

In their time at CfA, they were actively engaged in the civic tech startup movement. They created CfA’s Accelerator and Incubator Program and mentored 12 civic tech startups — all of which are still gaining traction and two of which have since been acquired. They also oversaw the deployment of civic technology in over 50 cities and hosted numerous events — including 4 CfA Summits — engaging key players throughout the civic tech landscape.
